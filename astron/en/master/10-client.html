    <h1 id="client-protocol">Client Protocol</h1>
<p><strong>Authors</strong><br><em>Sam &quot;CFSworks&quot; Edwards (09-17-2013)</em><br><em>Kevin &quot;Kestred&quot; Stenerson (10-08-2013)</em>  </p>
<h2 id="section-0-abstract">Section 0: Abstract</h2>
<p>This document describes the protocol used by clients to communicate with an Astron
cluster. This should not be confused with the <em>internal protocol</em>, which is used
by Astron servers to communicate amongst themselves. Instead, the client
protocol is used by game clients (running on the players&#39; computers) to communicate
with the Client Agent -- the gateway into the cluster. Because clients connect
to the Client Agent rather than directly into the Message Director, we will use
the terms &quot;gameserver&quot; and &quot;Client Agent&quot; interchangeably.</p>
<h2 id="section-1-basic-messaging-format">Section 1: Basic messaging format</h2>
<p>Unlike the internal protocol, the client protocol has a very simple messaging format.</p>
<pre><code>uint16 length;  // Length of the entire message, excluding the length tag
uint16 msgtype; // 16-bit identifier indicating what type of message is being sent
...             // message-specific data
</code></pre><p>Like the internal protocol, all multibyte integers are sent little-endian.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-typical-client-session">Section 2: Typical client session</h2>
<p>The client communicates with the server over a standard TCP connection. When the
client first connects, it is expected to send a <code>CLIENT_HELLO</code> message. This
message includes the hash of the DC file(s) and a (game-specific) version string.
The Client Agent will disconnect the client if either value differs from the
Client Agent&#39;s value. This is to ensure that out-of-date clients do not accidentally
connect to the gameserver.</p>
<p>After the <code>CLIENT_HELLO</code> is accepted, the client is in an &quot;unauthenticated&quot; state.
In this state, the client can send messages to certain, pre-approved objects, but
cannot open interest or do anything else. The objects are not announced to the
client: the client is expected to know their IDs in advance.</p>
<p>The purpose of this mechanism is to allow the client to provide suitable authentication
to the gameserver cluster. The authentication mechanism is entirely up to the
game developer: Astron does not mandate any sort of authentication method.</p>
<p>Once the client proves its identity to the server (through the aforementioned
pre-approved objects), the server will unrestrict the client, allowing it full
access to the normal gameserver logic. The client may then open interests to
discover already-existing objects in client-specified locations. The client may
also send field updates on any object, provided the field is tagged clsend.</p>
<p>The client is also permitted to &quot;own&quot; objects. These are objects where the server
grants the client additional privileges on those objects. The client may send
fields marked as &quot;ownsend&quot;, receive field updates for fields marked &quot;ownrecv&quot;,
and change the location of the owned objects at will.</p>
<p>When the client wishes to disconnect, it may simply close the TCP session.</p>
<h2 id="section-3-client-messages">Section 3: Client messages</h2>
<p>These are the messages that the client and Client Agent may send between each other
in order to accomplish various normal game tasks.</p>
<p><strong>CLIENT_HELLO (1)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 dc_hash, string version
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>This is the first message a client may send. The dc_hash is a 32-bit hash value
calculated from all fields/classes listed in the client&#39;s DC file. The version
is an app/game-specific string that developers should change whenever they
release a new client build. Both values are compared to the Client Agent&#39;s DC
file hash and configured version string to ensure that the client is fully
up-to-date. If the client is not up-to-date, it will be disconnected with
a <code>CLIENT_EJECT</code>. If the client is up-to-date, the gameserver will send
a <code>CLIENT_HELLO_RESP</code> to inform the client that it may proceed with its normal
logic flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_HELLO_RESP (2)</strong> <code>No arguments</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is sent by the Client Agent to the client when the client&#39;s <code>CLIENT_HELLO</code>
is accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_DISCONNECT (3)</strong> <code>No arguments</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is sent by the client to the Client Agent to notify that it is going
to close the connection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_EJECT (4)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint16 error_code, string reason
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>This is sent by the Client Agent to the client when the client is being
disconnected. The error_code and reason arguments provide some explanation as
to why the client is being dropped from the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_HEARTBEAT (5)</strong> <code>No arguments</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client should send this message on a regular interval. If the Client Agent
does not receive a <code>CLIENT_HEARTBEAT</code> for a certain (configurable) amount of time,
it will assume that the client has crashed and disconnect the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-3-1-client-object-messages">Section 3.1: Client Object Messages</h3>
<p><strong>CLIENT_ENTER_OBJECT_REQUIRED (142)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 do_id, uint32 parent_id, uint32 zone_id, uint16 dclass_id, &lt;REQUIRED&gt;
</code></pre><p><strong>CLIENT_ENTER_OBJECT_REQUIRED_OTHER (143)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 do_id, uint32 parent_id, uint32 zone_id, uint16 dclass_id, &lt;REQUIRED&gt;, &lt;OTHER&gt; 
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Inform the client of an object entering one of the client&#39;s interests.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is analogous to the <a href="12-stateserver#section-2-2-object-visibility-messages">StateServer</a>
          <code>OBJECT_ENTER_LOCATION</code> messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_ENTER_OBJECT_REQUIRED_OWNER (172)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 do_id, uint32 parent_id, uint32 zone_id, uint16 dclass_id, &lt;REQUIRED&gt;
</code></pre><p><strong>CLIENT_ENTER_OBJECT_REQUIRED_OTHER_OWNER (173)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 do_id, uint32 parent_id, uint32 zone_id, uint16 dclass_id, &lt;REQUIRED&gt;, &lt;OTHER&gt;
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Inform the client of an object entering ownership of the client.</p>
<p>This create message carries the additional semantic meaning that the object is
&quot;owned&quot; by this client, so the client should generate an &quot;ownerview&quot; (&quot;OV&quot;)
perspective rather than its normal client perspective.</p>
<p>The client will see this object even if it is not in interest (therefore,
parent_id and zone_id aren&#39;t necessarily covered by one of the client&#39;s interests)
and the client will receive all ownrecv field updates (but will only receive
broadcast if the object is visible).</p>
<p><em>Note: This is analogous to `STATESERVER_OBJECT_ENTER_OWNER</em>*` in the
       internal protocol._</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_OBJECT_SET_FIELD (120)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 do_id, uint16 field_id, &lt;VALUE&gt;
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>This is sent either by the Client Agent or the client to issue a field update
on a given object. The format of this message is analogous to 
<code>STATESERVER_OBJECT_SET_FIELD</code> in the internal protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_OBJECT_SET_FIELDS (121)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 do_id, uint16 num_fields, [uint16 field_id, &lt;VALUE&gt;]*num_fields
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>This is sent by the Client Agentto issue a field update on a given object.
The format of this message is analogous to <code>STATESERVER_OBJECT_SET_FIELDS</code>
in the internal protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_OBJECT_LEAVING (132)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 do_id
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>This is sent by the Client Agent to let the client know that an object is
leaving the client&#39;s visibility, either due to deletion, zone change, or
dropped interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_OBJECT_LOCATION (140)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 do_id, uint32 parent_id, uint32 zone_id
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>When the server sends this, it is informing the client that an object is moving
to another parent/zone that the client has interest in. If the object moves to a
location that the client does not have interest in, the object is leaving the
client&#39;s scope, and the server will therefore send a <code>CLIENT_OBJECT_LEAVING</code>
instead.</p>
<p>When the client sends this, it is requesting that the server move an object
<em>that it owns</em> to a given parent/zone. If the object is not owned, the server
will disconnect the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-3-2-client-interest-messages">Section 3.2: Client Interest Messages</h3>
<p><strong>CLIENT_ADD_INTEREST (200)</strong>  </p>
<pre><code>uint32 context, uint16 interest_id, uint32 parent_id, uint32 zone_id
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>The client sends this to open an interest in a single zone within a parent.
The server will respond by sending a CREATE for every object in the new zone,
followed by a <code>CLIENT_DONE_INTEREST_RESP</code>.</p>
<p>When the server sends this, it is informing the client of an interest added
to the client by the server with <code>CLIENTAGENT_ADD_INTEREST</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_ADD_INTEREST_MULTIPLE (201)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 context, uint16 interest_id, uint32 parent_id,
uint16 zone_count, [uint32 zone_id]*zone_count
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>The client sends this to open an interest cotaining multiple zones within a
single parent. The server will respond with a single DONE response after every
object from every zone replies.</p>
<p>When the server sends this, it is informing the client of an interest added
to the client by the server with <code>CLIENTAGENT_ADD_INTEREST_MULTIPLE</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_REMOVE_INTEREST (203)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 context, uint16 interest_id
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Remove interest added via a prior <code>CLIENT_ADD_INTEREST</code>. The server will send
<code>CLIENT_OBJECT_DISABLE</code>s for any objects that are no longer visible as a result,
followed by a <code>CLIENT_DONE_INTEREST_RESP</code>. Objects that are still visible due to
another, overlapping interest will be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLIENT_DONE_INTEREST_RESP (204)</strong></p>
<pre><code>uint32 context, uint16 interest_id
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Sent by the server to inform the client that an interest add/remove operation
for the given interest has completed. The context is the same as the
(client-chosen) context sent in the operation: this is to disambiguate
interests that might reuse the same interest ID.</p>
<p><em>Note: If a shard containing children of the parent object crashed/crashes a
       CLIENT_DONE_INTEREST_RESP may never be sent. As such a client should
       stop blocking on it after a reasonable timeout. In some cases, it may be
       acceptable or even preferred to not wait for the DONE_INTEREST_RESP at
       all and just act on objects as they come in.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-4-disconnect-reasons">Section 4: Disconnect reasons</h2>
<p>This section lists out a few of the disconnect reasons that the Client Agent
may give in a <code>CLIENT_EJECT</code> message, as well as a brief explanation for
each.</p>
<h3 id="section-4-1-ca-disconnect-reasons">Section 4.1: CA disconnect reasons</h3>
<p>These are reasons sent by the Client Agent itself. As such, clients should be
prepared to receive them even if nothing else in the cluster uses these codes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>106</strong> - The client sent an oversized datagram.</li>
<li><strong>107</strong> - The client&#39;s first message was not <code>CLIENT_HELLO</code>.</li>
<li><strong>108</strong> - The client sent an invalid msgtype.</li>
<li><strong>109</strong> - The client sent a truncated datagram.</li>
<li><strong>113</strong> - The client violated the rules of the anonymous sandbox.</li>
<li><strong>115</strong> - The client tried to send an unpermitted interest operation.</li>
<li><strong>117</strong> - The client tried to manipulate a nonexistent/unseen/unknown object ID.</li>
<li><strong>118</strong> - The client sent a <code>CLIENT_OBJECT_SET_FIELD</code> for a field they may not update.</li>
<li><strong>119</strong> - The client sent a <code>CLIENT_OBJECT_LOCATION</code> for an object they may not relocate.</li>
<li><strong>124</strong> - The client sent a <code>CLIENT_HELLO</code> with an invalid version string.</li>
<li><strong>125</strong> - The client sent a <code>CLIENT_HELLO</code> with an invalid DC hash.</li>
<li><strong>153</strong> - One of the client&#39;s &quot;session objects&quot; has been unexpectedly deleted.</li>
<li><strong>345</strong> - The client hasn&#39;t sent a <code>CLIENT_HEARTBEAT</code> for an extended period of time.</li>
<li><strong>347</strong> - The Client Agent had a network I/O error while trying to send a datagram.</li>
<li><strong>348</strong> - The Client Agent had a network I/O error while trying to read a datagram.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-4-2-generic-application-reasons">Section 4.2: Generic Application reasons</h3>
<p>The CA will not send these disconnect messages itself. They are entirely up to
the game developer to issue these codes via <code>CLIENTAGENT_DISCONNECT</code>. However,
we have reserved these codes for the convenience of game developers, as they may
be useful for certain games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>100</strong> - Another client logged in on the same account elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>122</strong> - Login issue; the login mechanism rejected the client&#39;s credentials.</li>
<li><strong>126</strong> - Administrative access violation; the client attempted to issue an administrator
command, but the gameserver did not authorize it.</li>
<li><strong>151</strong> - Client logged out by administrator command, not necessarily for rules violation.</li>
<li><strong>152</strong> - Client logged out (and possibly banned) by a moderator for rules violation.</li>
<li><strong>154</strong> - Gameserver is going down for maintenance.</li>
</ul>
